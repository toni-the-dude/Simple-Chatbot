# Simple Chatbot
This short project was made using the Rasa framework whilst following the Coursera 2-hour guided project <a href="https://www.coursera.org/projects/chatbot-rasa-python">"Create Your First Chatbot with Rasa and Python"</a>.

<p>This chatbot embodies the simple functionality of telling the time zone of one of several cities.</p>

<p>It was made using the default template for a chatbot provided by Rasa, which I then modified accordingly.</p>

<p>To be able to interact with the chatbot, run the command "rasa shell" in the directory "./Chatbot". 
  <br>In order to ascertain how the bot is interpreting the converstaion, use "rasa shell nlu" in the same directory.
  <br>Finally, if any adjustments are made to the code, retrain the bot with the updated code using "rasa train".
